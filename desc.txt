Build an iPhone app that accesses information about instructors and lets people rate
them. Use a table view to present some identifying information about each instructor. When the
user selects an instructor they get a view of more detailed information about that instructor.
The information available about an instructor is:
First name
Last name
Office
Phone
Email
Rating
Comments

We will also need to provide a way to rate an instructor on a scale of 1 to 5,
and provide comments about an instructor. 
The user can either add a comment about the instructor or rate the instructor or both.
